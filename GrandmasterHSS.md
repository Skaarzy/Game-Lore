Both were inner disciples of the same time and both had the same master yet they became each others opposite.


**Grandmaster Yuan Daqi (袁大奇) — "Wandering Ash"**
- An old man with dirt-caked robes, wild matted hair, and a beard that looks like it hasn’t been combed in decades.
- Blind, with a long scar stretching across left eye. Despite this, he walks with sure footing and rarely stumbles.
- Carries a rusted, absurdly long katana that looks like it was pulled from a grave—but it's said he could use a twig and still defeat a master.
- Lives more like a drifter than a Grandmaster, roaming the mountains and villages, often visiting sect branches unannounced.
- Known for laughter, strange stories, and meddling in mundane affairs for his own amusement.
- Many disciples meet him without realizing who he is until he vanishes, leaving only cryptic advice behind.
- Extroverted, unpredictable, and wise in an unorthodox way—his presence is chaotic, but his insights always hit the mark.

**Grandmaster Shen Yanjun (沈言君) — "Iron Crane"**
- Immaculately dressed in flowing, colorful robes stitched with rare silk, adorned with sect insignia.
- His black beard is always trimmed to a perfect line, and his hair neatly combed and oiled.
- Wields no sword—instead, he walks with a refined black cane and carries a lacquered parasol, not for need, but for appearance.
- A deeply introverted figure, rarely seen outside the sect’s ancestral halls or ceremonial chambers.
- Master of political maneuvering and internal doctrine.
- Known for speaking little but decisively—his words can change sect law, and his counsel is often the final voice before any major decision.
- Seen as the living standard of tradition and formality—where Yuan Daqi is the fire, Shen Yanjun is the water.
