ecame immortal - 1188
Died - unknown
The Beggar Sect is a vast underground force of unknown size, masters of disguise, deception, and survival. Most of its members live as beggars, unseen and ignored, but through them flows a silent river of secrets, information, and strange, deadly martial techniques. Few even know the sect exists. Fewer still suspect that this wandering beggar is its leader.Hong Qigong personally oversees the network of secret houses and hidden strongholds, known only to chosen beggars through cryptic signs and codes. Their martial techniques, though unorthodox, are unmatched in unpredictability and effectiveness. He is a ghost in the empire’s politics though his appearance is humble, Hong Qigong is a member of the imperial Censorate, advising emperors directly with truths no one else dares to speak. Yet his loyalty lies not with the throne, but with the people. Some say he lost his finger in a duel with a demon, others claim he cut it off as punishment for killing out of anger. Whatever the truth, his legend grows—and so does the reach of his beggars.
The Beggar Sect operates from the shadows, a vast and intricate underground force whose true size remains a mystery. Most of its members live in plain sight, blending seamlessly into the streets of the empire. Disguised as beggars, they are largely ignored by society, but within them runs an unseen current of secrets, rumors, and dangerous martial arts. They have perfected the art of deception, hiding in plain view and using their humble appearances to gather critical information and execute covert operations. The sect is known for its unorthodox and unpredictable fighting style. Its martial techniques are a strange blend of street-fighting, acrobatics, and stealth, making them lethal when least expected. Beggars often use seemingly innocuous objects, like a walking stick or a coin, as weapons, turning everyday tools into instruments of deadly precision. The techniques are highly effective in close combat, and many members specialize in trapping, ambushes, and counter-attacks, making them nearly impossible to defeat in their element.
Though the empire knows little of the Beggar Sect, its influence is far-reaching. Hidden houses, secret strongholds, and coded messages are scattered across the empire, known only to those who have earned the trust of the highest ranks within the sect. These hidden locations serve as meeting points and training grounds, where new recruits learn the ways of survival and deception. The members communicate through cryptic signs, a silent language only understood by those who have been initiated into the sect. Despite its lowly exterior, the Beggar Sect wields considerable power in the empire’s politics. Through its vast network, the sect has eyes and ears in every corner of the empire, keeping track of royal intrigues, military movements, and the actions of those in power. Their knowledge of the empire’s inner workings gives them leverage, and they have been known to intervene at pivotal moments, though always from the shadows. No one knows the true extent of their involvement, and even fewer suspect that one of the most humble beggars may hold the most influence of all. While the imperial throne is oblivious to the full reach of the Beggar Sect, its loyalty lies not with the rulers, but with the common people. The Beggars’ creed is simple: protect the powerless, serve the forgotten, and uphold the hidden truth. Those who threaten the common folk or exploit the weak are swiftly dealt with, often in ways that leave no trace.
