Sect master - Li Zhen (李震)(Supreme Sword Emperor) 
Became Immortal - 1286
Died - unknown
Sect itself was founded centuries ago by a legendary warrior, who sought to create a school where power could be tempered with honor. Li Zhen(third sect master) inherited the title of sect master not because of raw strength alone, but because of his calm demeanor, his ability to lead with wisdom, and his deep understanding of strategy. Li Zhen’s own combat style is based on the use of the Immortal Blade, an enormous sword passed down through the sect’s history. Though the weapon is immense and capable of great destruction, Li Zhen uses it with precise control, favoring efficiency and grace over sheer force. His power is so immense that his enemies often never see the full extent of his strength until it is too late. Under his leadership, the Heavenly Sword Sect has maintained its reputation as a sect of great honor and intellectual prowess, Li Zhen is revered not only as a master of martial arts but also as a strategist and a philosopher. His teachings inspire those who join the sect to pursue wisdom and personal growth, as well as to remain calm and disciplined, even in the face of overwhelming challenges. Though his sect is the strongest in the land, it is known for never flaunting its power. The sect's philosophy is to use strength only when absolutely necessary, maintaining peace and order through subtlety and wise counsel rather than overt displays of force. Li Zhen’s leadership ensures that the sect remains both a calming presence and a formidable force within the empire
