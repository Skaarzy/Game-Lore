Lei Tianba (雷天霸)(Thunder Tyrant of the Heavens)
Became Immortal - 1289
Died - unknown
Known as the Thunder Tyrant of the Heavens, Lei Tianba is the embodiment of overwhelming power and unstoppable force. His sect, Divine Thunder Hall, specializes in techniques that mimic the destructive and sudden nature of lightning—each strike powerful, explosive, and relentless. The sect’s fighting style is chaotic and sharp, focusing on swift, overwhelming bursts of force, capable of breaking through any defense. The sect itself is structured more like an army than a traditional martial arts sect, with each member occupying an equal position in terms of rank and authority. The only exception to this is the Sect Master, who stands as the sole leader, revered and followed without question. Members are drilled in unity and strength, each one trained to strike as one, with their combat techniques often coordinated like a thunderstorm tearing through the battlefield.Lei Tianba, the Sect Master, is known not only for his terrifying strength but also his position as the Grand Secretariat of the Emperor a high-ranking and influential position in the imperial court. As the emperor’s trusted adviser and enforcer, Lei’s influence extends beyond his sect and into the very heart of the empire. Though his sect is known for its thunderous battles, his political power ensures that his presence is also felt in the courts and halls of power. He commands with the authority of a tyrant, and his will is executed with the same speed and precision as a lightning strike. Lei Tianba is not a man of subtlety; when he makes his move, the world knows it.
