He is a figure that is said to guard the entrance of the main city of black forest assassins. He looks like an old man dressed in clean and neat clothes and look realy out of place. No one knows his origin, or even if he is entirely human. Some say he’s the first assassin, long retired. Others believe he’s the forest itself in human form.His voice is like dry wind through leaves. His movements are silent. He doesn’t threaten he simply appears, and his presence alone turns invaders cold with dread. Many who try to enter the city but are not invited die without ever seeing how.
