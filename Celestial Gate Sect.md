Wei Jian (魏简) (the Crane Behind the Curtain)
Became immortal - unknown
died - unknown
Wei Jian a cunning, charming, and ruthless man with a flawless reputation in court. His gentle voice masks razor-sharp calculation. As a high official in the imperial court, he controls channels of information across the empire. No one knows how far his reach extends and he was never seen using a weapon, and only that by the time you realize he’s involved, it’s already far too late.The sect he created is an elite and secretive sect that only accepts the children of nobles, high officials, and powerful families. They are an orthodox sect praised for their elegance, discipline, and intellect. In truth, the Celestial Gate Sect is a web of spies, informants, and manipulators woven directly into the empire’s foundation. Their cultivation techniques are entirely hidden from the public and displayed as simple and easy , no one outside the sect has ever witnessed the real techniques  in battle. Their strength lies not in brute force, but in control: of information, people, and power.The sect rose to prominence when its master became a major figure in the Heavenly Pavilion, the empire’s most sacred and powerful administrative body. Through this position, he embedded the sect deep into imperial infrastructure, using secrets and influence to elevate the sect into an officially recognized orthodox group. Disciples of the Celestial Gate are raised to be graceful, observant, and dangerous perfect spies, diplomats, and infiltrators. Their true teachings are passed down in whispers, their movements masked in ceremony, and their victories earned without ever drawing a blade. Enemies simply fall, reputations are ruined, and empires shift all without proof of their hand.
