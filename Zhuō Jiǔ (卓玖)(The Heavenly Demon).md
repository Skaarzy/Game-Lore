ruler of all of the demons
Feared by all sects—orthodox, unorthodox, or demonic—Zhuō Jiǔ is the undisputed ruler of the Demon Path. His name alone is forbidden in some temples, whispered in others as both warning and prophecy. He is not a sage, not a fallen immortal, but something wholly other. Born of blood and will, Zhuō Jiǔ is a demon whose very existence defies cultivation norms. His Qi is not gathered through meridian flow but created directly by his heart, a unique core that pulses with black fire and venomous intent. His body does not circulate Qi it generates it, raw and furious. He possesses the most powerful telekinesis in existence even that of the emperors is weaker, capable of shattering cities with invisible force or controlling thousands of blades like extensions of his fingers. His blood is corruptive and poisonous, able to infect others from the inside out. When he drinks the blood of enemies, it does not just restore him it turns their life into his, converting their energy into his Qi and prolonging his unending vitality. His most feared technique is the creation of the Supreme Asura Demons  solidified Qi beasts shaped by will alone. They are massive, violent, and utterly loyal, controlled like puppets from within his mind. The more he creates, and the stronger they are, the more his Qi is drained. But his enemies rarely last long enough for this to matter. He has no sect, no throne, and no army. But those abandoned by their sects, those discarded by empires, and those who have tasted betrayal all kneel before his shadow. Entire cults worship him as a living god, though he rarely visits. His doctrine is simple: “Power must not beg for permission.” He accepts no disciples, but if someone were to gain his interest, it would not be through loyalty or lineage but by surviving his presence and daring to look into his eyes without fear. It is said his katana a black blade with no name once belonged to the first demon he killed. Others say it belonged to the god who tried to kill him. He has never confirmed either.He has 6 so called commanders that offerd themselfs for him to do with them and command them as he wants.
