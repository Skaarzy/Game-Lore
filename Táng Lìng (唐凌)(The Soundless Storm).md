The sect’s enigmatic master, known only as Soundless Storm, is a blind, deaf, and elder who walks barefoot with a simple wooden cane. Though ancient and frail in appearance, every movement he makes is precise, every tap of his cane a ripple that maps the world around him, he speaks in whispers that are clear and Eco around those that he is speaking to . It is said that in battle, he needs only a single moment of silence to “read” the field, and that once he moves, its like a vigorous storm has been summoned around his enemies.Also was a Buddhist monk but quit because he wanted to help people outside of the temples.
