Grandmaster of the Black Forest Assassins
A ghost in the trees, a whisper in the dark — Yè Yǐng is not merely a killer, but a legend etched in silence. Known to the shadows as _Nightshade_, he is the grandmaster of the **Black Forest Assassins**, a sect so elusive its existence is denied even by those who have hired them. The Black Forest is not a place — it is a presence, a chill that enters the spine before the end arrives.
Yè Yǐng is the embodiment of that presence. He does not pursue his prey; he waits. Still, patient, and precise. To face him is not to engage in battle, but to feel the cold inevitability of death draw near — quiet, calm, and absolute. His techniques are so refined that resistance often vanishes before a blade is ever revealed. Fear becomes the weapon; surrender, the kill.His weapon are two blades on the back of his hands which can withdraw inside his sleeves and pop out when he needs them. None actually no what his techniques are or what type of power he posses because none have survived to tell the tale.He is also missing a leg and has a wooden replacement, some say he put a seed of a Black forest tree in his leg and it grew in-place of it.
Under his leadership, the Black Forest Assassins do not operate as mere murderers for hire. They are executioners of fate. Their creed is silence, their currency is secrecy. Each initiate is trained to erase not just lives, but traces — whispers, memories, and even rumors. To kill like Yè Yǐng is to become as invisible as the wind through dead leaves.
Despite leading the deadliest order in the empire, Yè Yǐng is rarely seen. His directives come like falling petals — sudden, weightless, and unmistakable. Few have heard his voice. Fewer have seen his eyes. But those who do remember only the feeling: the breathless terror before the dark.
To the world, he is a myth wrapped in twilight. To the underworld, he is the final breath of autumn — still, silent, and always fatal.
They say when the shadows grow long and the night turns quiet, that is when _Nightshade_ walks again.
