Swordfall City is nestled at the foot of **Mount Tianjian (天剑山)**. At the base of the mountain, a deep, jagged **crack** runs wide and dark—a natural fissure said to have been carved by a sword strike so powerful it split the mountain’s foundation.At the top there are some cracks that look like slashes made by swords it is said that is where the elders and grand-masters train and perfect their technique.The crack at the bottom serves as the **hidden entrance** to an extensive network of ancient **sect caves and training grounds** beneath the mountain. Only those trusted by the Heavenly Sword Sect may enter, accessing sacred chambers where masters refine their skills and protect treasured relics. The city spreads across the lower slopes and valley around Mount Tianjian, fortified by sturdy walls and natural cliffs. It is the sect’s bustling capital, home to grand halls, training fields, marketplaces, and the residences of disciples and elders.
The crack in the mountain stands as a silent testament to the sect’s legendary origins—a symbol of the power and legacy held within Swordfall City.
