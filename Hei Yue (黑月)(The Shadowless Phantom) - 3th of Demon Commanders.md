The Third Demon Commander, Hei Yue is a creature of silence and fear a phantom cloaked in shadow and smoke, moving between worlds like a whisper of death. While others roar, blaze, or command armies, Hei Yue says nothing. His presence is like a cold draft in the dead of nightunnatural, unnoticed… until it is too late. He never speaks unless directly addressed by Zhuō Jiǔ, and even then, his replies are brief, emotionless, and quiet. He does not need to assert his power his mere existence is a constant reminder that death can come without warning, without form, and without mercy. His body is barely physical, surrounded by a dark, flowing mist that seems to drink in light itself. Cultivators say that even in sunlight, his silhouette flickers like smoke, and in battle, he often vanishes entirely. What he leaves behind are corpses cleanly slain, without sound or struggle. His movements are untraceable, and he walks without footprints or scent, making him nearly impossible to track.Only Zhuō Jiǔ has saw his face. Despite appearing as a mere servant or shadow at the side of other commanders, Hei Yue is arguably the most dangerous of them all, and the only one who regularly stands near Zhuō Jiǔ without speaking. Many believe he serves as the Heavenly Demon’s personal executioner, a blade hidden behind the throne. He wields no blade in hand his shadow itself transforms and becomes his weapon, stretching, slicing, piercing, and corrupting. He can melt into the ground, rise behind opponents, or even pass through walls and barriers. It is said his Qi is not alive, but ghostly, impossible to sense until it is too late. Even among demon commander, no one trusts Hei Yue not because he is disloyal, but because he is too quiet, too still, never sleeps and is faceless
